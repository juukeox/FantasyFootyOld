This app is built on React  for the front end and has required me to learn JSX, CSS and more.
Complex Python implementation has allowed for a variety of tasks for the flask back end.
The app is now in the process of being refined so that it can be one clean, installable file for use on desktop and mobile.
Suggestions welcome!
